Subject: [PATCH 3/8] Fix LONG_BIT constant to be always 32bit

Starting from Emscripten 3.1.50, there is an issue where LONG_BIT is
calculated to 64 for some reason. This is very strange because LONG_MAX
becomes 2^64-1 when calculating LONG_BIT (in limits.h), but it then
becomes 2^32-1 when it is accessed in other places.

I wasn't able to make a minimal code to reproduce a bug. Probably
something is messed up while importing pyconfig.h, etc.
