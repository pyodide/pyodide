Subject: [PATCH] Don't dereference function pointer

Ctypes thinks that the result of dlsym is a pointer to the function pointer, so
it should call it like `result = (*f)(args)`. Probably this is true for the
native dlsym, but our dlsym returns an index into the indirect call table
"wasmTable", in particular it isn't even aligned like a pointer should be.
This patch fixes it so that it calls it like `result = f(args)` instead.
