Subject: [PATCH 2/3] Add useful error when symbol resolution fails

Currently if symbol resolution fails, we get:
```js
TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'apply')
```
It is very hard for newcomers to Emscripten to recognize this as a
symbol resolution error. Even for people experienced with this message,
it has the annoyance that it doesn't give any hint as to which symbol
went missing.

This adds a descriptive error message with the name of the missing
symbol.
