# Release notes

## Verison [Unreleased]
### Breaking changes

- Removed iodide-specific code in `pyodide.js`. This breaks compatibility with
  iodide.
  [#878](https://github.com/iodide-project/pyodide/pull/878),
  [#981](https://github.com/iodide-project/pyodide/pull/981)
- Use upstream `file_packager.py`, and stop checking package abi versions.
  The `PYODIDE_PACKAGE_ABI` environment variable is no longer used, but is
  still set as some packages use it to detect whether it is being built for
  pyodide. This usage is deprecated, and a new environment variable `PYODIDE`
  is introduced for this purpose.

  As part of the change, Module.checkABI is no longer present.
  [#991](https://github.com/iodide-project/pyodide/pull/991)

### Added
- `micropip` now supports installing wheels from relative urls. [#872](https://github.com/iodide-project/pyodide/pull/872)

## Version 0.16.1
*December 25, 2020*

Note: due to a CI deployment issue the 0.16.0 release was skipped and replaced
by 0.16.1 with identical contents.

- Pyodide files are distributed by [JsDelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com/),
  `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/pyodide/v0.16.1/full/pyodide.js`
  The previous CDN `pyodide-cdn2.iodide.io` still works and there
  are no plans for deprecating it. However please use
  JsDelivr as a more sustainable solution, including for earlier pyodide
  versions.

### Python and the standard library

- Pyodide includes CPython 3.8.2
  [#712](https://github.com/iodide-project/pyodide/pull/712)
- ENH Patches for the threading module were removed in all packages.
  Importing the module, and a subset of functionality (e.g. locks) works,
  while starting a new thread will produce an exception, as expected.
  [#796](https://github.com/iodide-project/pyodide/pull/796). See
  [#237](https://github.com/iodide-project/pyodide/pull/237) for the current
  status of the threading support.
- ENH The multiprocessing module is now included, and will not fail at import,
  thus avoiding the necessity to patch included packages. Starting a new process
  will produce an exception due to the limitation of the WebAssembly VM  with
  the following message: `Resource temporarily unavailable`
  [#796](https://github.com/iodide-project/pyodide/pull/796).

### Python / JS type conversions

- FIX Only call `Py_INCREF()` once when proxied by PyProxy
  [#708](https://github.com/iodide-project/pyodide/pull/708)
- Javascript exceptions can now be raised and caught in Python. They are
  wrapped in pyodide.JsException.
  [#891](https://github.com/iodide-project/pyodide/pull/891)

### pyodide-py package and micropip

- The `pyodide.py` file was transformed to a pyodide-py package. The imports
  remain the same so this change is transparent to the users
  [#909](https://github.com/iodide-project/pyodide/pull/909).
- FIX Get last version from PyPi when installing a module via micropip
  [#846](https://github.com/iodide-project/pyodide/pull/846).
- Suppress REPL results returned by `pyodide.eval_code` by adding a semicolon
  [#876](https://github.com/iodide-project/pyodide/pull/876).
- Enable monkey patching of `eval_code` and `find_imports` to customize behavior
  of `runPython` and `runPythonAsync`
  [#941](https://github.com/iodide-project/pyodide/pull/941).

### Build system

- Updated docker image to Debian buster, resulting in smaller images.
  [#815](https://github.com/iodide-project/pyodide/pull/815)
- Pre-built docker images are now available as
  [`iodide-project/pyodide`](https://hub.docker.com/r/iodide/pyodide)
  [#787](https://github.com/iodide-project/pyodide/pull/787)
- Host python is no longer compiled, reducing compilation time. This also
  implies that python 3.8 is now required to build pyodide. It can for instance
  be installed with conda.
  [#830](https://github.com/iodide-project/pyodide/pull/830)
- FIX Infer package tarball directory from source url
  [#687](https://github.com/iodide-project/pyodide/pull/687)
- Updated to emscripten 1.38.44 and binaryen v86
  (see related [commits](https://github.com/iodide-project/pyodide/search?q=emscripten&type=commits))
- Updated default `--ldflags` argument to `pyodide_build` scripts to equal what
  pyodide actually uses.
  [#817](https://github.com/iodide-project/pyodide/pull/480)
- Replace C lz4 implementation with the (upstream) Javascript implementation.
  [#851](https://github.com/iodide-project/pyodide/pull/851)
- Pyodide deployment URL can now be specified with the `PYODIDE_BASE_URL`
  environment variable during build. The `pyodide_dev.js` is no longer distributed.
  To get an equivalent behavior with `pyodide.js`, set,
  ```
  window.languagePluginUrl = './';
  ```
  before loading it.
  [#855](https://github.com/iodide-project/pyodide/pull/855)
- Build runtime C libraries (e.g. libxml) via package build system with correct
  dependency resolution
  [#927](https://github.com/iodide-project/pyodide/pull/927)
- Pyodide can now be built in a conda virtual environment
  [#835](https://github.com/iodide-project/pyodide/pull/835)

### Other improvements

- Modifiy MEMFS timestamp handling to support better caching. This in particular allows to
  import newly created python modules without invalidating import caches
  [#893](https://github.com/iodide-project/pyodide/pull/893)

### Packages
- New packages: freesasa, lxml, python-sat, traits, astropy, pillow,
  scikit-image, imageio, numcodecs, msgpack, asciitree, zarr

  Note that due to the large size and the experimental state of the scipy
  package, packages that depend on scipy (including scikit-image, scikit-learn)
  will take longer to load, use a lot of memory and may experience failures.

- Updated packages: numpy 1.15.4, pandas 1.0.5, matplotlib 3.3.3 among others.
- New package
  [pyodide-interrupt](https://pypi.org/project/pyodide-interrupts/), useful for
  handling interrupts in Pyodide (see project descripion for details).


### Backward incompatible changes

- Dropped support for loading .wasm files with incorrect MIME type, following
  [#851](https://github.com/iodide-project/pyodide/pull/851)

## Version 0.15.0
*May 19, 2020*

- Upgrades pyodide to CPython 3.7.4.
- micropip no longer uses a CORS proxy to install pure Python packages from
  PyPi. Packages are now installed from PyPi directly.
- micropip can now be used from web workers.
- Adds support for installing pure Python wheels from arbitrary URLs with micropip.
- The CDN URL for pyodide changed to
  https://pyodide-cdn2.iodide.io/v0.15.0/full/pyodide.js
  It now supports versioning and should provide faster downloads. The latest release
  can be accessed via `https://pyodide-cdn2.iodide.io/latest/full/`
- Adds `messageCallback` and `errorCallback` to
  {ref}`pyodide.loadPackage <js_api_pyodide_loadPackage>`.
- Reduces the initial memory footprint (`TOTAL_MEMORY`) from 1 GiB to 5 MiB. More
  memory will be allocated as needed.
- When building from source, only a subset of packages can be built by setting
  the `PYODIDE_PACKAGES` environment variable. See
  {ref}`partial builds documentation <partial-builds>` for more details.
- New packages: future, autograd

## Version 0.14.3
*Dec 11, 2019*

- Convert JavaScript numbers containing integers, e.g. `3.0`, to a real Python
  long (e.g. `3`).

## Version 0.12.0
*May 3, 2019*

**User improvements:**

- Packages with pure Python wheels can now be loaded directly from PyPI. See
  {ref}`micropip` for more information.

- Thanks to PEP 562, you can now `import js` from Python and use it to access
  anything in the global Javascript namespace.

- Passing a Python object to Javascript always creates the same object in
  Javascript. This makes APIs like `removeEventListener` usable.

- Calling `dir()` in Python on a JavaScript proxy now works.

- Passing an `ArrayBuffer` from Javascript to Python now correctly creates
  a `memoryview` object.

- Pyodide now works on Safari.

## Version 0.11.0
*Apr 12, 2019*

**User improvements:**

- Support for built-in modules:
  - `sqlite`, `crypt`

- New packages: `mne`

**Developer improvements:**

- The `mkpkg` command will now select an appropriate archive to use, rather than
  just using the first.

- The included version of emscripten has been upgraded to 1.38.30 (plus a
  bugfix).

- New packages: `jinja2`, `MarkupSafe`

## Version 0.10.0
*Mar 21, 2019*

**User improvements:**
