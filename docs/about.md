# About the Project

The Python scientific stack, compiled to WebAssembly.

Pyodide brings the Python runtime to the browser via WebAssembly, along with
the Python scientific stack including NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, parts of
SciPy, and NetworkX. The [packages
directory](https://github.com/iodide-project/pyodide/tree/master/packages)
lists over 35 packages which are currently available.

Pyodide provides transparent conversion of objects between Javascript and
Python. When used inside a browser, Python has full access to the Web APIs.

While closely related to the [iodide project](https://iodide.io), a tool for
*literate scientific computing and communication for the web*, Pyodide goes
beyond running in a notebook environment. To maximize the flexibility of the
modern web, **Pyodide** may be used standalone in any context where you want to
**run Python inside a web browser**.
