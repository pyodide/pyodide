# About Pyodide

Python with the scientific stack, compiled to WebAssembly.

Pyodide may be used in any context where you want to run Python inside a web
browser.

Pyodide brings the Python 3.8 runtime to the browser via WebAssembly, along with
the Python scientific stack including NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, SciPy, and
scikit-learn. The [packages
directory](https://github.com/pyodide/pyodide/tree/main/packages) lists over
75 packages which are currently available. In addition it's possible to install
pure Python wheels from PyPi.

Pyodide provides transparent conversion of objects between Javascript and
Python. When used inside a browser, Python has full access to the Web APIs.
