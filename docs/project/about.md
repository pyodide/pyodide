# What is Pyodide?

Pyodide is a Python distribution for the browser and Node.js based on WebAssembly/[Emscripten](https://emscripten.org/).

Pyodide makes it possible to install and run Python packages in the browser with
[micropip](https://pyodide.org/en/stable/usage/api/micropip-api.html). Any pure
Python package with a wheel available on PyPI is supported. Many packages with C
extensions have also been ported for use with Pyodide. These include many
general-purpose packages such as regex, PyYAML, lxml and scientific Python
packages including NumPy, pandas, SciPy, Matplotlib, and scikit-learn.

Pyodide comes with a robust Javascript ðŸ¡˜ Python foreign function interface so
that you can freely mix these two languages in your code with minimal
friction. This includes full support for error handling (throw an error in one
language, catch it in the other), async/await, and much more.

When used inside a browser, Python has full access to the Web APIs.

## History

Pyodide was created in 2018 by [Michael Droettboom](https://github.com/mdboom)
at Mozilla as part of the [Iodide
project](https://github.com/iodide-project/iodide). Iodide is an experimental
web-based notebook environment for literate scientific computing and
communication.
