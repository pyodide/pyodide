# Loading packages

Only the Python standard library is available after importing Pyodide.
To use other packages, youâ€™ll need to load them using either:
 - {any}`pyodide.loadPackage` for packages built with Pyodide, or
 - {any}`micropip.install` for pure Python packages with wheels available on PyPi or
   from other URLs.

```{note}
{mod}`micropip` can also be used to load packages built in Pyodide (in
which case it relies on {any}`pyodide.loadPackage`).
```

If you use {any}`pyodide.loadPackagesFromImports` Pyodide will automatically
download all packages that the code snippet imports. This is particularly useful
for making a repl since users might import unexpected packages. At present,
`loadPackagesFromImports` will not download packages from PyPi, it will only
download packages included in the Pyodide distribution.

## Loading packages with {any}`pyodide.loadPackage`

Packages included in the official Pyodide repository can be loaded using
{any}`pyodide.loadPackage`:
```js
pyodide.loadPackage('numpy');
```
It is also possible to load packages from custom URLs:
```js
pyodide.loadPackage('https://foo/bar/numpy.js');
```
The file name in the URL must be `/<package-name>.js` and there must be an
accompanying `.data` file in the same directory.

When you request a package from the official repository, all of that package's
dependencies are also loaded. Dependency resolution is not yet implemented when
loading packages from custom URLs.

In general, loading a package twice is not permitted. However, one can override
a dependency by loading a custom URL with the same package name before loading
the dependent package.

Multiple packages can also be loaded at the same time by passing a list to `loadPackage.
```js
pyodide.loadPackage(['cycler', 'pytz']);
```

{any}`pyodide.loadPackage` returns a `Promise` which resolves when all of the
packages are finished loading:
```javascript
let pyodide;
async function main(){
  pyodide = await loadPyodide({ 'indexURL' : '<some-url>' });
  await pyodide.loadPackage('matplotlib');
  // matplotlib is now available
}
main();
```

## Micropip

### Installing packages from PyPI

Pyodide supports installing pure Python wheels from PyPI with {mod}`micropip`.
{func}`micropip.install` returns a Python `Future
<https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-future.html>`_ so you can await the
future or otherwise use the Python future API to do work once the packages have
finished loading:

```pyodide
pyodide.runPythonAsync(`
  import micropip
  await micropip.install('snowballstemmer')
  import snowballstemmer
  stemmer = snowballstemmer.stemmer('english')
  print(stemmer.stemWords('go goes going gone'.split()))
`);
```

Micropip implements file integrity validation by checking the hash of the
downloaded wheel against pre-recorded hash digests from the PyPi JSON API.

### Installing wheels from arbitrary URLs

Pure Python wheels can also be installed from any URL with {mod}`micropip`,
```py
import micropip
micropip.install(
    'https://example.com/files/snowballstemmer-2.0.0-py2.py3-none-any.whl'
)
```
Micropip decides whether a file is a URL based on whether it ends in ".whl" or not.
The wheel name in the URL must follow [PEP 427 naming
convention](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0427/#file-format), which will
be the case if the wheels is made using standard Python tools (`pip wheel`,
`setup.py bdist_wheel`).

All required dependencies must have been previously installed with {mod}`micropip`
or {any}`pyodide.loadPackage`.

If the file is on a remote server, the server must set Cross-Origin Resource Sharing
(CORS) headers to allow access. Otherwise, you can prepend a CORS proxy to the
URL. Note however that using third-party CORS proxies has security implications,
particularly since we are not able to check the file integrity, unlike with
installs from PyPi.

      await pyodide.runPythonAsync(`
        import micropip
        await micropip.install('snowballstemmer')
        import snowballstemmer
        stemmer = snowballstemmer.stemmer('english')
        print(stemmer.stemWords('go goes going gone'.split()))
      `);
