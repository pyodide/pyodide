<!-- Contribution Guide -->
<!--
We welcome contributions to this section.
If you have an example you would like to share, please submit a pull request in the Pyodide repository.

To add an example, create a new file in the `examples` directory, we expect the example is a single HTML file
that contains everything needed to run the example, so people can easily download and run it locally.

You can start with copying the template file (`examples/examples.html.tmpl`). Note that the template file contains
a placeholder URL {{ PYODIDE_BASE_URL }} that will be replaced by the actual URL when the documentation is built.
So please do not remove it.

After you have added the example, please add a link to it in the list above.
Feel free to add some description to the example if you like and add your name as the author.
