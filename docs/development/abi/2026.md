# pyodide_2026_0 (under development)

By default, all builds of the Pyodide runtime with Python 3.14 will use the
`pyodide_2026_0` abi.

This section reflects the aspirational ABI for `pyodide_2026_0`. This is all
subject to change without notice.

The Emscripten version is 5.0.0.

### The Rust toolchain

Rust packages that targets `pyodide_2026_0` ABI should use the toolchain with `1.93.0` or later, to enable
`emscripten-wasm-eh` feature.

## Libraries Linked to the Interpreter

Pyodide is statically linked with the following libraries:

- `libegl.js`
- `libeventloop.js`
- `libGL`
- `libhtml5_webgl.js`
- `libhtml5.js`
- `liblz4`
- `libsdl.js`
- `libwebgl.js`
- `libwebsocket.js`
- `bzip2`
- `zlib`
- `sqlite3` (new)
- `lzma` (new)

All of these come from Emscripten ports and the versions of these libraries are
determined by the version of Emscripten we build with. Any symbols from these
static libraries may be used by shared libraries.
