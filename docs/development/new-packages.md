# Creating a Pyodide package

It is recommended to look into how other similar packages are built in Pyodide.
If you encounter difficulties in building your package after trying the steps
listed here, open a [new Pyodide issue](https://github.com/pyodide/pyodide/issues).

## Quickstart

If you wish to use a package in Pyodide that is not already included, first you
need to determine whether it is necessary to package it for Pyodide. Ideally,
you should start this process with package dependencies.

### 1. Determining if creating a Pyodide package is necessary

Most pure Python packages can be installed directly from PyPI with
{func}`micropip.install` if they have a pure Python wheel. Check if this is the
case by going to the `pypi.org/project/<package-name>` URL and checking if the
"Download files" tab contains a file that ends with `*py3-none-any.whl`.

If the wheel is not on PyPI, but nevertheless you believe there is nothing
preventing it (it is a Python package without C extensions):

- you can create the wheel yourself by running,
  ```
  python -m pip install build
  python -m build
  ```
  from within the package folder where the `setup.py` are located. See the
  [Python packaging guide](https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/packaging-projects/#generating-distribution-archives)
  for more details. Then upload the wheel file somewhere (not to PyPI) and
  install it with micropip via its URL.
- you can also open an issue in the package repository asking the authors to
  upload the wheel.

If however the package has C extensions or its code requires patching, then
continue to the next steps.

```{note}
To determine if a package has C extensions, check if its `setup.py` contains
any compilation commands.
```

### 2. Creating the `meta.yaml` file

If your package is on PyPI, the easiest place to start is with the 
{ref}`mkpkg tool <pyodide-mkpkg>`. From the Pyodide root directory, install the
tool with `pip install -e pyodide-build`, then run:

`pyodide-build mkpkg <package-name>`

This will generate a `meta.yaml` under `package/<package-name>/` (see
{ref}`meta-yaml-spec`) that should work out of the box for many simple Python
packages. This tool will populate the latest version, download link and sha256
hash by querying PyPI. It doesn't currently handle package dependencies, so you
will need to specify those yourself.

You can also use the `meta.yaml` of other Pyodide packages in the `packages/`
folder as a starting point.

```{note}
To reliably determine build and runtime dependencies, including for non Python
libraries, it is often useful to verify if the package was already built on
[conda-forge](https://conda-forge.org/) and open the corresponding `meta.yaml`
file. This can be done either by checking if the URL
`https://github.com/conda-forge/<package-name>-feedstock/blob/master/recipe/meta.yaml`
exists, or by searching the [conda-forge GitHub
org](https://github.com/conda-forge/) for the package name.

The `meta.yaml` in Pyodide was inspired by the one in conda, however it is
not strictly compatible.
```

### 3. Building the package and investigating issues

Once the `meta.yaml` is ready, build the package with the following commands
from inside the package directory `packages/<package-name>`
```
export PYTHONPATH="$PYTHONPATH:/path/to/pyodide/pyodide-build/"
python -m pyodide_build buildpkg meta.yaml
cp build/*.data build/*.js ../../build/
```
and see if there are any errors.

If there are errors you might need to

- patch the package by adding `.patch` files to `packages/<package-name>/patches`
- add the patch files to the `source/patches` field in the `meta.yaml` file

then restart the build. 

#### Generating patches 

If the package has a git repository, the easiest way to make a patch is usually:
1. Clone the git repository. You might want to use the options `git clone
   --depth 1 --branch <version-tag>`. Find the appropriate tag given the version
   of the package you are trying to modify.
2. Make whatever changes you want. Commit them.
3. Use `git format-patch HEAD~1 -o <pyodide-root>/packages/<package-name>/patches/` 
   to generate a patch file for your changes and store it directly into the
   patches folder.

It is also possible to create a patch with `git diff --no-index old_file
new_file > my_changes.patch`, but you will probably have to fix up the paths in
the generated diff. If it is taking a large number of attempts, you can use the
flags `--src-prefix` and `--dst-prefix` to try to ensure the patch file is
generated with the correct paths.


## The package build pipeline

Pyodide includes a toolchain to make it easier to add new third-party Python
libraries to the build. We automate the following steps:

- Download a source tarball (usually from PyPI)
- Confirm integrity of the package by comparing it to a checksum
- Apply patches, if any, to the source distribution
- Add extra files, if any, to the source distribution
- If the package includes C/C++/Cython extensions:
  - Build the package natively, keeping track of invocations of the native
    compiler and linker
  - Rebuild the package using emscripten to target WebAssembly
- If the package is pure Python:
  - Run the `setup.py` script to get the built package
- Unvendor unit tests included in the installation folder to a separate package
  `<package name>-tests`
- Package the results into an emscripten virtual filesystem package, which
  comprises:
  - A `.data` file containing the file contents of the whole package,
    concatenated together
  - A `.js` file which contains metadata about the files and installs them into
    the virtual filesystem.

Lastly, a `packages.json` file is output containing the dependency tree of all
packages, so {any}`pyodide.loadPackage` can load a package's dependencies
automatically.

#### Partial Rebuilds

By default, each time you run `buildpkg`, `pyodide-build` will delete the entire
source directory and replace it with a fresh copy from the download url. This is
to ensure build repeatability. For debugging purposes, this is likely to be
undesirable. If you want to try out a modified source tree, you can pass the
flag `--continue` and `buildpkg` will try to build from the existing source
tree. This can cause various issues, but if it works it is much more convenient.

Using the `--continue` flag, you can modify the sources in tree to fix the
build, then when it works, copy the modified sources into your checked out copy
of the package source repository and use `git format-patch` to generate the
patch.

For very complicated builds, we also have a mechanism for repeating from the
replay stage of the build. If the build is failing during the replay stage, you
will see lines like `[line 766 of 1156]` labeling which command is being
replayed. `--continue=replay` will start over from the begining of the replay
stage, `--continue=replay:766` will start from step 766 of the replay stage.


## C library dependencies

Some Python packages depend on certain C libraries, e.g. `lxml` depends on
`libxml`.

To package a C library, create a directory in `packages/` for the C library. In
the directory, you should write `meta.yaml` that specifies metadata about the
library. See {ref}`meta-yaml-spec` for more details.

The minimal example of `meta.yaml` for a C library is:

```yaml
package:
  name: <name>
  version: <version>

source:
  url: <url>
  sha265: <sha256>

requirements:
  run:
    - <requirement>

build:
  library: true
  script: |
    emconfigure ./configure
    emmake make -j ${PYODIDE_JOBS:-3}
```

You can use the `meta.yaml` of other C libraries such as
[libxml](https://github.com/pyodide/pyodide/blob/main/packages/libxml/meta.yaml)
as a starting point.

After packaging a C library, it can be added as a dependency of a Python package
like a normal dependency. See `lxml` and `libxml` for an example (and also
`scipy` and `CLAPACK`).

_Remark:_ Certain C libraries come as emscripten ports, and do not have to be
built manually. They can be used by adding e.g. `-s USE_ZLIB` in the `cflags` of
the Python package. See e.g. `matplotlib` for an example. [The full list of
libraries with Emscripten ports is
here.](https://github.com/orgs/emscripten-ports/repositories?type=all)

## Structure of a Pyodide package

This section describes the structure of a pure Python package, and how our build
system creates it. In general, it is not recommended to construct these by
hand; instead create a Python wheel and install it with micropip.

Pyodide is obtained by compiling CPython into WebAssembly. As such, it loads
packages the same way as CPython --- it looks for relevant files `.py` files in
`/lib/python3.x/`. When creating and loading a package, our job is to put our
`.py` files in the right location in emscripten's virtual filesystem.

Suppose you have a Python library that consists of a single directory
`/PATH/TO/LIB/` whose contents would go into
`/lib/python3.9/site-packages/PACKAGE_NAME/` under a normal Python installation.

The simplest version of the corresponding Pyodide package contains two files ---
`PACKAGE_NAME.data` and `PACKAGE_NAME.js`. The first file `PACKAGE_NAME.data` is
a concatenation of all contents of `/PATH/TO/LIB`. When loading the package via
`pyodide.loadPackage`, Pyodide will load and run `PACKAGE_NAME.js`. The script
then fetches `PACKAGE_NAME.data` and extracts the contents to emscripten's
virtual filesystem. Afterwards, since the files are now in `/lib/python3.9/`,
running `import PACKAGE_NAME` in Python will successfully import the module as
usual.

To construct this bundle, we use the `file_packager.py` script from emscripten.
We invoke it as follows:

```sh
$ ./tools/file_packager.sh \
     PACKAGE_NAME.data \
     --js-output=PACKAGE_NAME.js \
     --preload /PATH/TO/LIB/@/lib/python3.9/site-packages/PACKAGE_NAME/
```

The arguments can be explained as follows:

- PACKAGE_NAME.data indicates where to put the data file
- --js-output=PACKAGE_NAME.js indicates where to put the javascript file
- `--preload` instructs the package to look for the file/directory before the
  separator `@` (namely `/PATH/TO/LIB/`) and place it at the path after the `@`
  in the virtual filesystem (namely
  `/lib/python3.9/site-packages/PACKAGE_NAME/`).

`file_packager.sh` adds the following options:

- `--lz4` to use LZ4 to compress the files
- `--export-name=globalThis.__pyodide_module` tells `file_packager` where to
  find the main Emscripten module for linking.
- `--exclude *__pycache__*` to omit the pycache directories
- `--use-preload-plugins` says to [automatically decode files based on their
  extension](https://emscripten.org/docs/porting/files/packaging_files.html#preloading-files)
  The preload plugins are important if the package contains any `.so` files
  because `WebAssembly.instantiate` is asynchronous.
