# How to Contribute

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Pyodide! There are many ways to
contribute, and we appreciate all of them. Here are some guidelines & pointers
for diving into it.

## Development Workflow

See {ref}`building_from_sources` and {ref}`testing` documentation.

For code-style the use of [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) is also recommended,
```
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install
```
This will run a set of linters at each commit. Currently it runs yaml syntax
validation and is removing trailing whitespaces.

## Code of Conduct

Pyodide has adopted a {ref}`code-of-conduct` that we expect all contributors and
core members to adhere to.

## Development

Work on Pyodide happens on Github. Core members and contributors can make Pull
Requests to fix issues and add features, which all go through the same review
process. We’ll detail how you can start making PRs below.

We’ll do our best to keep `main` in a non-breaking state, ideally with tests
always passing. The unfortunate reality of software development is sometimes
things break. As such, `main` cannot be expected to remain reliable at all
times. We recommend using the latest stable version of Pyodide.

Pyodide follows semantic versioning (http://semver.org/) - major versions for
breaking changes (x.0.0), minor versions for new features (0.x.0), and patches
for bug fixes (0.0.x).

We keep a file, {ref}`docs/changelog.md <changelog>`, outlining changes to
Pyodide in each release. We like to think of the audience for changelogs as
non-developers who primarily run the latest stable. So the change log will
primarily outline user-visible changes such as new features and deprecations,
and will exclude things that might otherwise be inconsequential to the end user
experience, such as infrastructure or refactoring.

## Bugs & Issues

We use [Github Issues](https://github.com/pyodide/pyodide/issues) for
announcing and discussing bugs and features. Use
[this link](https://github.com/pyodide/pyodide/issues/new) to report a
bug or issue. We provide a template to give you a guide for how to file
optimally. If you have the chance, please search the existing issues before
reporting a bug. It's possible that someone else has already reported your
error. This doesn't always work, and sometimes it's hard to know what to search
for, so consider this extra credit. We won't mind if you accidentally file a
duplicate report.

Core contributors are monitoring new issues & comments all the time, and will
label & organize issues to align with development priorities.



## How to Contribute

Pull requests are the primary mechanism we use to change Pyodide. GitHub itself
has some
[great documentation](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/)
on using the Pull Request feature. We use the "fork and pull" model
[described here](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/),
where contributors push changes to their personal fork and create pull requests
to bring those changes into the source repository.

Please make pull requests against the `main` branch.

If you’re looking for a way to jump in and contribute, our list of
[good first issues](https://github.com/pyodide/pyodide/labels/good%20first%20issue)
is a great place to start.

If you’d like to fix a currently-filed issue, please take a look at the comment
thread on the issue to ensure no one is already working on it. If no one has
claimed the issue, make a comment stating you’d like to tackle it in a PR. If
someone has claimed the issue but has not worked on it in a few weeks, make a
comment asking if you can take over, and we’ll figure it out from there.

We use [pytest](https://pytest.org), driving
[Selenium](https://www.seleniumhq.org) as our testing framework. Every PR will
automatically run through our tests, and our test framework will alert you on
Github if your PR doesn’t pass all of them. If your PR fails a test, try to
figure out whether or not you can update your code to make the test pass again,
or ask for help. As a policy we will not accept a PR that fails any of our
tests, and will likely ask you to add tests if your PR adds new functionality.
Writing tests can be scary, but they make open-source contributions easier for
everyone to assess. Take a moment and look through how we’ve written our tests,
and try to make your tests match. If you are having trouble, we can help you get
started on our test-writing journey.

All code submissions should pass `make lint`.  Python is checked with the
default settings of `flake8`.  C and Javascript are checked against the Mozilla
style in `clang-format`.

### Contributing to the “core” C Code

See {ref}`contributing-core`.

## Documentation

Documentation is a critical part of any open source project and we are very
welcome to any documentation improvements. Pyodide has a documentation written
in Markdown in the `docs/` folder. We use the
[MyST](https://myst-parser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/using/syntax.html#targets-and-cross-referencing)
for parsing Markdown in sphinx.  You may want to have a look at the
[MyST syntax guide](https://myst-parser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/using/syntax.html#the-myst-syntax-guide)
when contributing, in particular regarding
[cross-referencing sections](https://myst-parser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/using/syntax.html#targets-and-cross-referencing).

### Building the docs
From the directory ``docs``, first install the Python dependencies with
``pip install -r requirements-doc.txt``. You also need to install JsDoc, which is a
``node`` dependency. Install it with ``sudo npm install -g jsdoc``. Then to
build the docs run ``make html``. The built documentation will be in the
subdirectory ``docs/_build/html``. To view them, cd into ``_build/html`` and
start a file server, for instance ``http-server``.

## Migrating patches

It often happens that patches need to be migrated between different versions of
upstream packages.

If patches fail to apply automatically, one solution can be to
1. Checkout the initial version of the upstream package in a separate repo, and
   create a branch from it.
2. Add existing patches with `git apply <path.path>`
3. Checkout the new version of the upstream package and create a branch from it.
4. Cherry-pick patches to the new version,
   ```
   git cherry-pick <commit-hash>
   ```
   and resolve conflicts.
5. Re-export last `N` commits as patches e.g.
   ```
   git format-patch -<N> -N --no-stat HEAD -o <out_dir>
   ```
