Pyodide is a Python distribution for the browser and Node.js based on WebAssembly.

## What is Pyodide?

Pyodide is a port of CPython to WebAssembly/[Emscripten](https://emscripten.org/).

Pyodide makes it possible to install and run Python packages in the browser with
[micropip](https://pyodide.org/en/stable/usage/api/micropip-api.html). Any pure
Python package with a wheel available on PyPi is supported. Many packages with C
extensions have also been ported for use with Pyodide. These include many
general-purpose packages such as regex, PyYAML, lxml and scientific Python
packages including NumPy, pandas, SciPy, Matplotlib, and scikit-learn.

Pyodide comes with a robust Javascript ‚ü∫ Python foreign function interface so
that you can freely mix these two languages in your code with minimal friction.
This includes full support for error handling, async/await, and much more.

When used inside a browser, Python has full access to the Web APIs.

## Try Pyodide (no installation needed)

Try Pyodide in a
[REPL](https://pyodide.org/en/stable/console.html) directly in
your browser. For further information, see the
[documentation](https://pyodide.org/en/stable/).

## Getting Started

Pyodide offers three different ways to get started depending on your needs and
technical resources. These include:

- Use a hosted distribution of Pyodide: see the [Getting
  Started](https://pyodide.org/en/stable/usage/quickstart.html) documentation.
- Download a version of Pyodide from the [releases
  page](https://github.com/pyodide/pyodide/releases/) and serve it
  with a web server.
- [Build Pyodide from source](https://pyodide.org/en/stable/development/building-from-sources.html)
  - Build natively with `make`: primarily for Linux users who want to
    experiment or contribute back to the project.
  - [Use a Docker image](https://pyodide.org/en/stable/development/building-from-sources.html#using-docker):
    recommended for Windows and macOS users and for Linux users who prefer a
    Debian-based Docker image with the dependencies already installed.

## History

Pyodide was created in 2018 by [Michael Droettboom](https://github.com/mdboom)
at Mozilla as part of the [Iodide
project](https://github.com/iodide-project/iodide). Iodide is an experimental
web-based notebook environment for literate scientific computing and
communication.

Iodide is no longer maintained. If you want to use Pyodide in an interactive
client-side notebook, see [Pyodide notebook
environments](https://pyodide.org/en/stable/project/related-projects.html#notebook-environments-ides-repls).
