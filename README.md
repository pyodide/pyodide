# [Pyodide](https://github.com/iodide-project/pyodide)


[![Build Status](https://circleci.com/gh/iodide-project/pyodide.png)](https://circleci.com/gh/iodide-project/pyodide)
[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/pyodide/badge/?version=latest)](https://pyodide.readthedocs.io/?badge=latest)

The Python scientific stack, compiled to WebAssembly.

[**Try Pyodide and Iodide in your browser**](https://alpha.iodide.io/notebooks/300/)

## What is Pyodide?

**Pyodide** brings the Python runtime to the browser via WebAssembly, along with the Python scientific stack including NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, parts of SciPy, and NetworkX. The [`packages` directory](https://github.com/iodide-project/pyodide/tree/master/packages) lists over 35 packages which are currently available.

**Pyodide** provides transparent conversion of objects between Javascript and Python.
When used inside a browser, Python has full access to the Web APIs.

While closely related to the [iodide project](https://iodide.io), a tool for *literate scientific computing and communication for the web*, Pyodide goes beyond running in a notebook environment. To maximize the flexibility of the modern web, **Pyodide** may
be used standalone in any context where you want to **run Python inside a web
browser**.

## Try Pyodide (no installation needed)

For more information, try [the demo](https://alpha.iodide.io/notebooks/300/) and look through the
[documentation](https://pyodide.readthedocs.io/).

## Getting Started

Pyodide offers three different ways to get started depending on your needs and technical resources.
These include:

- [Download a pre-built version](#download-a-pre-built-version) (the quickest way to get started)
- [Build Pyodide from source](#building-from-source) (this method requires installing prerequistes and using `make`. Primarily for Linux users who want to experiment or contribute back to the project.)
- [Use a Docker image](#using-docker) (recommended for Windows and macOS users and for Linux users who prefer a Debian-based Docker image on Docker Hub with the dependencies
already installed)


### Download a pre-built version

Pre-built versions of Pyodide may be downloaded from
this repository's [releases page](https://github.com/iodide-project/pyodide/releases/).


### Building from source

Building is easiest on Linux and relatively straightforward on Mac. For
Windows, we currently recommend using the Docker image (described below) to
build Pyodide.

Make sure the prerequisites for [emsdk](https://github.com/emscripten-core/emsdk) are
installed. Pyodide will build a custom, patched version of emsdk, so there is no
need to build it yourself prior.

Additional build prerequisites are:

- A working native compiler toolchain, enough to build CPython.
- A native Python 3.7 to run the build scripts.
- PyYAML
- [lessc](http://lesscss.org/) to compile less to css.
- [uglifyjs](https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS) to minify Javascript builds.
- gfortran (GNU Fortran 95 compiler)
- [f2c](http://www.netlib.org/f2c/)
- [ccache](https://ccache.samba.org) (optional) *highly* recommended for much faster rebuilds.

On Mac, you will also need:

- [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) for installing dependencies
- System libraries in the root directory (`sudo installer -pkg /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/Packages/macOS_SDK_headers_for_macOS_10.14.pkg -target /` should do it, see https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv/issues/1219#issuecomment-428305417)
- coreutils for md5sum and other essential Unix utilities (`brew install coreutils`)
- cmake (`brew install cmake`)
- pkg-config (`brew install pkg-config`)
- openssl (`brew install openssl`)
- gfortran (`brew cask install gfortran`)
- f2c: Install wget (`brew install wget`), and then run the buildf2c script from the root directory (`sudo ./tools/buildf2c`)

#### Build using `make`

After installing the build prerequisites, run from the command line:

```bash
make
```

### Using Docker

We provide a Debian-based Docker image on Docker Hub with the dependencies
already installed to make it easier to build Pyodide. Note that building from
the Docker image is *very* slow on Mac, building on the host machine is
preferred if at all possible.

1. Install Docker

2. From a git checkout of Pyodide, run `./run_docker`

3. Run `make` to build.

If running ``make`` deterministically stops at one point in each subsequent try, increasing
the maximum RAM usage available to the docker container might help [This is different
from the physical RAM capacity inside the system]. Ideally, at least 3 GB of RAM
should be available to the docker container to build `pyodide` smoothly. These settings can
be changed via Docker Preferences [See [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44533319/how-to-assign-more-memory-to-docker-container)].

You can edit the files in your source checkout on your host machine, and then
repeatedly run `make` inside the Docker environment to test your changes.

## Contributing

Please view the [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md) document for tips on filing
issues, making changes, and submitting pull requests. The following sections
describe how to run tests, run Pyodide benchmarks, and lint the source code.


### Testing

Install the following dependencies into the default Python installation:

```bash
pip install pytest selenium pytest-instafail
```

Install [geckodriver](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases) and
[chromedriver](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads)
and check that they are in your `PATH`.

### Automated testing

To run the pytest suite of tests, type on the command line:

```bash
pytest test/ packages/
```

### Manual interactive testing

To run manual interactive tests, a docker environment and a webserver will be
used.

1. Bind port 8000 for testing. To automatically bind port 8000 of the docker
environment and the host system, run: `./run_docker`

2. Now, this can be used to test the `pyodide` builds running within the
docker environment using external browser programs on the host system. To do
this, run: `./bin/pyodide serve`

3. This serves the ``build`` directory of the ``pyodide`` project on port 8000.
    * To serve a different directory, use the ``--build_dir`` argument followed
      by the path of the directory.
    * To serve on a different port, use the ``--port`` argument followed by the
      desired port number. Make sure that the port passed in ``--port`` argument
      is same as the one defined as ``DOCKER_PORT`` in the ``run_docker`` script.


4. Once the webserver is running, simple interactive testing can be run by
   visiting this URL:
   [http://localhost:8000/console.html](http://localhost:8000/console.html)

### Benchmarking

To run common benchmarks to understand Pyodide's performance, begin by
installing the same prerequisites as for testing. Then run:

```bash
make benchmark
```

### Linting

Python is linted with `flake8`.  C and Javascript are linted with
`clang-format`.

To lint the code, run:

```bash
make lint
```
