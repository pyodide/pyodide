Subject: [PATCH 06/15] disable blas detection

BLAS and LAPACK aren't available on host because we only cross compile these
libraries (see CLAPACK/meta.yaml). Scipy tries to detect these libraries and
if it fails to find them errors out the build. But we have them installed
correctly for our target, so we just disable this detection mechanism.
