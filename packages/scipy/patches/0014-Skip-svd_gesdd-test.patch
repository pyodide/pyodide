Subject: [PATCH 14/17] Skip svd_gesdd test

This patch excludes a test for gesdd which was introduced in this PR:
https://github.com/scipy/scipy/pull/20349. It is not useful for Pyodide
since it is a memory-intensive test and it is not expected to pass in
a WASM environment where allocating memory for large arrays is tricky.

This patch has been upstreamed in https://github.com/scipy/scipy/pull/21349
and it can be safely removed once SciPy v1.15.0 is released and is being
integrated in Pyodide.
