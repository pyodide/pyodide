Subject: [PATCH 10/16] Remove cuncsd, dorcsd, sorcsd, zuncsd

These functions don't work because their definitions involve code that isn't
fortran 77 compliant. In order to get _flapack.so to link correctly, we need
to provide stub definitions for these functions, but they don't work. Remove
them to make sure people get an `AttributeError` if they try to use them
rather than just having weird buggy code.
