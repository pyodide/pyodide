Subject: [PATCH 4/7] fix f2clibs build

emscripten produces LLVM bitcode here, not genuine object files, so it doesn't
make sense to strip symbols.

(It would also fail because emcc uses the file extension to determine what kind
of object to output, and .xxx is not a recognized extension; this is the error
message you would receive if you try to run the commands)
