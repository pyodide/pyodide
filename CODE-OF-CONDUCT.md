# Code of Conduct

## Conduct

We are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of level of experience, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, religion, nationality, or other similar characteristic.

- Please be kind and courteous. There’s no need to be mean or rude.
- Please avoid using usernames that are overtly sexual or otherwise might detract from a friendly, safe, and welcoming environment for all.
- Respect that people have differences of opinion and that every design or implementation choice carries trade-offs. There is seldom a single right answer.
- We borrow the Recurse Center’s [“social rules”](https://www.recurse.com/manual#sub-sec-social-rules): no feigning surprise, no well-actually’s, no backseat driving, and no subtle -isms.
- Please keep unstructured critique to a minimum. If you have solid ideas you want to experiment with, make a fork and see how it works. All feedback should be constructive in nature. If you need more detailed guidance around giving feedback, consult [Digital Ocean’s Code of Conduct](https://github.com/digitalocean/engineering-code-of-conduct#giving-and-receiving-feedback)
- It is unacceptable to insult, demean, or harass anyone. We interpret the term “harassment” as defined in the [Citizen Code of Conduct](https://github.com/stumpsyn/policies/blob/master/citizen_code_of_conduct.md#4-unacceptable-behavior); if you are not sure about what harassment entails, please read their definition. In particular, we don’t tolerate behavior that excludes people in socially marginalized groups.
- Private harassment is also unacceptable. No matter who you are, please contact any of the Pyodide core team members immediately if you are being harassed or made uncomfortable by a community member. Whether you are a regular contributor or a newcomer, we care about making this community a safe place for you and we’ve got your back.
- Likewise spamming, trolling, flaming, baiting or other attention-stealing behavior is not welcome.

## Moderation

These are the policies for upholding our community’s standards of conduct. If you feel that a thread needs moderation, please contact the Pyodide core team.

1. Remarks that violate the Pyodide standards of conduct are not allowed. This includes hateful, hurtful, oppressive, or exclusionary remarks. (Cursing is allowed, but never targeting another community member, and never in a hateful manner.)
2. Remarks that moderators find inappropriate are not allowed, even if they do not break a rule explicitly listed in the code of conduct.
3. Moderators will first respond to such remarks with a warning.
4. If the warning is unheeded, the offending community member will be temporarily banned.
5. If the community member comes back and continues to make trouble, they will be permanently banned.
6. Moderators may choose at their discretion to un-ban the community member if they offer the offended party a genuine apology.
7. If a moderator bans someone and you think it was unjustified, please take it up with that moderator, or with a different moderator, in private. Complaints about bans in-channel are not allowed.
8. Moderators are held to a higher standard than other community members. If a moderator creates an inappropriate situation, they should expect less leeway than others.
9. In the Pyodide community we strive to go the extra mile to look out for each other. Don’t just aim to be technically unimpeachable, try to be your best self. In particular, avoid flirting with offensive or sensitive issues, particularly if they’re off-topic; this all too often leads to unnecessary fights, hurt feelings, and damaged trust; worse, it can drive people away from the community entirely.
10. If someone takes issue with something you said or did, resist the urge to be defensive. Just stop doing what it was they complained about and apologize. Even if you feel you were misinterpreted or unfairly accused, chances are good there was something you could have communicated better — remember that it’s your responsibility to make your fellow Pyodide community members comfortable. Everyone wants to get along and we are all here first and foremost because we want to talk about science and cool technology. You will find that people will be eager to assume good intent and forgive as long as you earn their trust.
11. The enforcement policies listed above apply to all official Pyodide venues. If you wish to use this code of conduct for your own project, consider making a copy with your own moderation policy so as to avoid confusion.
