Important Note:

Opening a new package request doesn't mean that Pyodide maintainers will look into it immediately.
In most cases, the maintainer will have no idea about the package you're asking for, and you're probably the most knowledgeable person about it.
Therefore, a way to speed up your progress is to read the documentation, try building the package yourself, and report any issues you encounter.
