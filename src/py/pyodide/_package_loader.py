    This is a helper method called from ``loadPackage``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    filename
        The name of the file we are extracting. We only care about it to figure
        out whether the buffer represents a tar file or a zip file.

    buffer
        A Javascript ``Uint8Array`` with the binary data for the archive.

    target
        Controls which directory the package is installed into. Either "site"
        which installs the package into the sitepackages directory or "lib"
        which installs the package into the standard library.

    Returns
    -------
        A Javascript Array of paths to dynamic libraries ('.so' files) that were
        in the archive. We need to precompile these Wasm binaries in
        `load-pyodide.js`. These paths point to the unpacked locations of the

    ----------
    archive
        A binary representation of either a zip or a tar archive. We use the `.name`
        field to determine which file type.

    target_dir
        The directory the archive is unpacked into. Paths will be adjusted to point
        inside this directory.
