# When the pyodide package is imported, both the js and the pyodide_js modules
# will be available to import from. Not all functions in pyodide_js will work
# until after pyodide is first imported, imported functions from pyodide_js
# should not be used at import time. It is fine to use js functions at import
# time.
#
# All pure Python code that does not require js or pyodide_js should go in
# the _pyodide package.
#
# This package is imported by the test suite as well, and currently we don't use
# pytest mocks for js or pyodide_js, so make sure to test "if IN_BROWSER" before
# importing from these.
