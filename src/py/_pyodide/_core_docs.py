        :ref:`type-translations-jsproxy-to-py` for more information.

        ``default_converter`` if present will be invoked whenever Pyodide does
        not have some built in conversion for the object.
        If ``default_converter`` raises an error, the error will be allowed to
        propagate. Otherwise, the object returned will be used as the
        conversion. ``default_converter`` takes three arguments. The first
        argument is the value to be converted.

        Here are a couple examples of converter functions. In addition to the
        normal conversions, convert ``Date`` to ``datetime``:

        .. code-block:: python

            from datetime import datetime
            def default_converter(value, _ignored1, _ignored2):
                if value.constructor.name == "Date":
                    return datetime.fromtimestamp(d.valueOf()/1000)
                return value

        Don't create any JsProxies, require a complete conversion or raise an error:

        .. code-block:: python

            def default_converter(_value, _ignored1, _ignored2):
                raise Exception("Failed to completely convert object")

        The second and third arguments are only needed for converting
        containers. The second argument is a conversion function which is used
        to convert the elements of the container with the same settings. The
        third argument is a "cache" function which is needed to handle self
        referential containers. Consider the following example. Suppose we have
        a Javascript ``Pair`` class:

        .. code-block:: javascript

            class Pair {
                constructor(first, second){
                    this.first = first;
                    this.second = second;
                }
            }

        We can use the following ``default_converter`` to convert ``Pair`` to ``list``:

        .. code-block:: python

            def default_converter(value, convert, cache):
                if value.constructor.name != "Pair":
                    return value
                result = []
                cache(value, result);
                result.append(convert(value.first))
                result.append(convert(value.second))
                return result

        Note that we have to cache the conversion of ``value`` before converting
        ``value.first`` and ``value.second``. To see why, consider a self
        referential pair:

        .. code-block:: javascript

            let p = new Pair(0, 0);
            p.first = p;

        Without ``cache(value, result);``, converting ``p`` would lead to an
        infinite recurse. With it, we can successfully convert ``p`` to a list
        such that ``l[0] is l``.

                result.push(convert(value.second))
                return result

        Note that we have to cache the conversion of ``value`` before converting
        ``value.first`` and ``value.second``. To see why, consider a self
        referential pair:

        .. code-block:: javascript

            p = Pair(0, 0);
            p.first = p;

        Without ``cache(value, result);``, converting ``p`` would lead to an
        infinite recurse. With it, we can successfully convert ``p`` to an Array
        such that ``l[0] === l``.
